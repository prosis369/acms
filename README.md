Central Seller Connect
A common platform where sellers can upload their details, (shop details, products, etc.).
Any e-commerce site that wants to connect with the sellers can get the details from these platform. 
The idea is to solve the pain point of sellers having to upload their data individually on every new site, and new e-commerce sites having to do their own research into the market and reaching out these sellers.
